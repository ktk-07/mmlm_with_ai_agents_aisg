# Description of the problem
Develop a Multimodality Large Language Model or Agent to do Video Question Answering.
Not just that, the video might be confusing and misleading.
Another issue is that the prompt itself maybe be misleading with regards to the model itself.

# Breaking the Problem Down
Basically the main point is that the multi-modal model should be able to understand if a video is played in reverse or not inverse.
The catch here is that 
Even if a prompt given is misleading, we should be able to look at specific details in the video itself.
